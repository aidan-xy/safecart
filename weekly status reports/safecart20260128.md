# Weekly Progress Report 2026/01/28

## High level goal:
Finish the minimum viable product, which will have a rudimentary algorithm, page scraping, and trustworthiness display.

## Original goals for the week:
N/A

## Progress and issues:
* More research is required to fully flesh out the project - specifically, which website we want to start with.
* The development plan has been completed, where we learned what we wanted by defining the direction of the project
* Working in a group went well, with the online meetings serving a useful purpose.

## Questions for the product owner:
* Does the architecture of our project differ from others due to the fact that we are creating a browser extension instead of a standalone app?

## Goals for next week:
* Finish the achitecture/design of the SafeCart extension - 1 week
* Establish what trustworthy/suspicious/fine entails - 1/2 meetings

* The development plan has been completed, where we learned what we wanted by defining the direction of the project
* Working in a group went well, with the online meetings serving a useful purpose.

## Questions for the product owner:
* Does the architecture of our project differ from others due to the fact that we are creating a browser extension instead of a standalone app?

## Goals for next week:
